# premium-bonds

This mini-project was inspired by the problem described here:
https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/premium-bonds/

The aim was to create a fast interactive calculator to work out the odds of winning in the UK NS&I Premium Bonds prize draw, a surprisingly challenging algorithm.

As I am currently working through the Odin Project, I have implemented this as a client-side (no-build, JS only) webpage.
